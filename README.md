## Pump it up

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, we must predict which pumps are functional, need some repairs, and which don't work at all.
A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

This repo contains my EDA, data cleaning, feature selection and modelling work for this DrivenData competition where I currently hold a top 4% score (0.8235). You can also find some additional experiments I performed for a set of Medium articles I wrote on this competition.

## ADVENTURE WORKS POWER BI SALES REPORT Demand

In preparation for my DA-100 exam, I retook the Power BI course from Maven Analytics on Udemy. Less than a year ago, I created a dynamic dashboard in Excel. In comparison to some of the formulas I wrote then to make the dashboard perform the way I needed it, I can say that Power BI and Dax are an absolute delight. 



  - Created a Sales Report in Power BI giving detailed insights on best-selling products and customers
  - Imported data from Excel and used Power Query to transform the data
  - Created a data model in Power BI and used DAX to create calculated columns and measures
  - Improved user experience by applying conditional formatting, drillthrough filters and visual interactions
